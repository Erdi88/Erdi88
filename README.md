## Hi 👋 I'm Sondre Erdi Solbakken

I'm a Master's student in **Energy** with a background in **Physics**, interested in
**computational modeling, data-driven methods, and software tools for energy and engineering problems**.

I like working on problems where physical understanding, data, and computation meet —  
from simulation workflows to machine learning and applied data analysis.

This GitHub is a collection of **structured, reproducible projects** that reflect how I think, build, and experiment with technical systems.
